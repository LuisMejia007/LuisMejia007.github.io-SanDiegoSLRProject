# LuisMejia007.github.io-SanDiegoSLRProject
Hello and welcome, this is a website I made for a school project. The project was of our choosing, this project is based on rising sea levels and how it will affect the city of San Diego. Although our class was only instructed to write a research paper and provide maps that we created, I wanted to go a step further with the project. I wanted to make a website in order to showcase the severity of the problem. I wanted users to immerse into the reality of this problem, and I knew a research paper just wouldn't be enough. I hope you enjoy!
